# :gear: prjctVes-API
**prjctVes-API** is a REST API I developed to be used by [prjctVes](https://github.com/MaiTra10/prjctVes) to allow it to interact with its DynamoDB table and retrieve Steam Market and stock price data. I created this REST API through the use of the AWS API Gateway and Lambda functions.

While this isn't meant to be a publicly available API as I only use it internally to retrieve data for the Discord bot (authorized via private API key), I will provide documentation for the different API Gateway resources.
